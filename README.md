The game I am making is Trivia. It will consist of three different categories: MotoGP, Formula 1, Rally Cross. The user will also receive a special winning message if they get all questions right. The MVPâ€™s that i have to complete first are rendering the game, have a functioning game, make it look pretty, and display a special winning message if you get all questions right. Some of my stretch goals would be to add a ranked leader board, choosing difficulty, and adding tons more categories. The technologies I will use to create this game are Javascript, HTML, Jquery, and CSS.
