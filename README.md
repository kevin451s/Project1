#About Trivia

The game I made is Trivia. It consists of two different categories: MotoGP and Formula 1. The user will test their knowledge of MotoGP and Formula 1 by selecting an answer that corresponds with the question. After finishing the quiz they receive a message in their console showing their score.

#Approach Taken
The first step I took to create the game was making a wireframe. I had an idea of how I wanted it to look and function. I then pseudo-coded the javascript. After translating the idea into a plan I set to work. I created an html file with empty divs, buttons, and a couple headers. I then worked on the javascript to fill in the empty divs and buttons. After writing the javascript, I began to style my index.html file with a separate css stylesheet.

#Problems/Future Development
Problems with program include awkward display on certain devices due to no media queries. My reset button also doesn't work. I will work on these in the future. I will also perhaps work on a score board in the future.

#MVP
1. Start Button actually starts the game
2. 2 different categories to choose from
3. The game changes the divs color to green or red depending on whether the user answered a question right.
